# bengali-word-quiz
A simple vocabulary game for the Bengali language.

## Set up
You'll need Node and Yarn installed. I use [**volta**](https://volta.sh/).

## Scripts

`yarn build` – Builds the app to dist using the Parcel bundler.

`yarn start` – Runs parcel in develop mode.

`yarn lint` – Lints code with eslint.

`yarn test` – Runs Jest test runner.
